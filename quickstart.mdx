# Quickstart

Get started in 5 minutes

Diffusive Labs is a high-performance inference platform that serves generative AI models. All models are accessible through `completions` and `chat completions` API endpoints. Using our API, you can build with popular open-source models and custom fine-tuned models like Mixtral, Llama, and more.

Try out all our models in our interactive model playground!

This quickstart guide will help you begin in minutes. For more detailed information, please refer to our guides section or API reference.

In this guide, you will:
* Set up your development environment
* Choose an SDK
* Call the Diffusive Labs API with an API Key

## Account Creation

Create a Diffusive Labs account. Navigate to Account Settings and click on API Keys to generate your key. Make sure to store the API Key securely.

## Set up developer environment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python (Diffusive)">
    ### 1. Install SDK
    
    Before installing, ensure you have Python installed. We recommend setting up a virtual environment.
    
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade diffusive-ai
    ```
    
    The Diffusive Python Client is OpenAI API Compatible.

    ### 2. Configure API Key

    ```bash
    # MacOS/Linux
    export DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY="<API_KEY>"

    # Windows
    setx DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY "<API_KEY>"
    ```

    ### 3. Send your first API Request

    ```python
    from diffusive.client import Diffusive

    client = Diffusive(api_key="<DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY>")
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="accounts/diffusive/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }],
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python (OpenAI)">
    ### 1. Install SDK
    
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade openai
    ```

    ### 2. Configure Client

    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        base_url="https://api.diffusive.ai/v1",
        api_key="<DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY>",
    )

    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="accounts/diffusive/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test",
        }],
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="JavaScript (OpenAI)">
    ### 1. Install SDK
    
    ```bash
    npm install openai
    ```

    ### 2. Configure Client

    ```javascript
    import OpenAI from 'openai';

    const openai = new OpenAI({
      baseURL: 'https://api.diffusive.ai/v1',
      apiKey: 'DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY',
    });

    const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
      model: "accounts/diffusive/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: "Say this is a test"
      }],
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl https://api.diffusive.ai/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIFFUSIVE_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "model": "accounts/diffusive/models/mixtral-8x7b-instruct",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Say this is a test"
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
