# Concepts

This document outlines basic Diffusive Labs concepts.

## Resources

### Account

Your account is the top-level resource under which other resources are located. Quotas and usage limits are enforced at the account level.

For developer accounts, the account ID is automatically generated from your signup email. Enterprise accounts have the option to choose a custom, unique account ID.

### User

A user is an email address associated with an account. Only users who have been added to an account can access private resources within that account.

### Model

A model represents a set of model weights and associated metadata. Models must be deployed to one or more deployments to be used for inference, creating a "deployed model". We support two types of models:

* Base models
* Parameter-efficient fine-tuned (PEFT) addons

For more details, see our Models overview page.

### Deployment

A deployment is a collection of one or more model servers that host a base model and optionally one or more PEFT addons (also known as LoRA adapters).

Diffusive Labs provides "serverless" deployments hosting popular base models. These deployments can be used for both serverless inference and hosting serverless addons.

### Deployed Model

A deployed model is an instance of a base model or PEFT addon that has been loaded into a deployment and is ready for inference.

### Dataset

A dataset is an immutable collection of training examples used for fine-tuning models.

### Fine-tuning Job

A fine-tuning job is an offline training process that uses a dataset to train a PEFT addon model.

## Resource Names and IDs

A full resource name follows this format:

accounts/my-account/models/my-model


The individual segments `my-account` and `my-model` are account and model IDs, respectively.

Resource IDs must follow these constraints:
* Length between 1 and 63 characters (inclusive)
* Can only contain lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-)
* Cannot begin or end with a hyphen (-)

Some APIs require the full resource name, while others may accept just the resource ID when the context is clear.

## Control Plane and Data Plane

The Diffusive Labs API is divided into two main components:

* **Control Plane**: APIs used for managing resource lifecycles, including account, models, and deployments management.
* **Data Plane**: APIs used for inference and the backend services that power them.

## Interfaces

Users can interact with Diffusive Labs through multiple interfaces:

* **Web Console**: Access through https://diffusive.ai
* **CLI**: Use our command-line tool `diffctl`
* **Python SDK**: Our official Python client library
* **REST API**: Direct API access for custom integrations
