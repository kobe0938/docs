# Introduction

Diffusive Labs is a generative AI inference platform to run and customize models with industry-leading speed and production-readiness.

## Welcome to Diffusive Labs

## What we offer

The Diffusive Labs platform empowers developers to create generative AI systems with the best quality, cost and speed. All publicly available services are pay-as-you-go with developer friendly pricing.

* **Inference:** Run generative AI models on Diffusive Labs-hosted infrastructure with our optimized inference engine. Multiple inference options ensure there's always a fit for your use case.
* **Modalities and Models:** Use 100s models (or bring your own) across modalities of:
  * Text
  * Audio
  * Image
  * Embedding
  * Vision-understanding
* **Adaptation:** Tune and optimize your model and deployment for the best results. Serve and experiment with hundreds of fine-tuned models with our multi-LoRA capabilities.
* **Compound AI Development Framework:** Use JSON mode, grammar mode, function calling or our framework to build a collaborative system with reliable and performant outputs.

## Inference

Diffusive Labs has 3 options for running generative AI models with unparalleled speed and costs.

* **Serverless**: The easiest way to get started. Use the most popular models on pre-configured GPUs. Pay per token and avoid cold boots.
* **On-demand**: The most flexible option for scaling. Use private GPUs to support your specific needs and only pay when you're using it. Our optimized infrastructure offers both improved throughput and latency. Excels for:
  * **Production volume** - Per-token costs decrease with more volume and there are no set rate limits
  * **Custom needs and reliability** - On-demand GPUs are private to you. This enables complete control to tailor deployments for speed/throughput/reliability or to run more specialized models
* **Enterprise Reserved GPUs**: Use private GPUs with hardware and software set-up personally tailored by the Diffusive Labs team for your use case. Enjoy SLAs, dedicated support, bring-your-own-cloud (BYOC) deployment options, and enterprise-only optimizations.

| Property | **Serverless** | **On-demand** | **Enterprise reserved** |
